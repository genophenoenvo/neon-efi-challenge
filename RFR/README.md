# Machine Learning Models

This folder contains the scripts, models, and data needed to forecast phenology (as measured by gcc_90 and/or rcc_90) using machine learning models for the [NEON Ecological Forecast Challenge](https://ecoforecast.org/efi-rcn-forecast-challenges/). The challenges included:
* <b>Spring 2021</b>: gcc_90 and gcc_sd predictions for the next 35 days for 8 NEON sites. Three versions using random forest regressor (PEG_RFR0, PEG_RFR, PEG_RFR2) were submitted.

* <b>Fall 2021:</b> gcc_90, gcc_sd, rcc_90, rcc_sd predictions for the next 35 days for 8 NEON sites. Continued submissions of the previous three versions of models using Random Forest Regressor, and developed a new model incorporating an ensemble ML approach (PEG_FUSION_0)  

* <b>Spring 2022:</b> gcc_90, gcc_sd, rcc_90, rcc_sd predictions for the next 35 days for 18 NEON sites. Continued submission of PEG_FUSION_0 from the previous season after extending it to 18 sites and developed a new idea using identical PEG_FUSION_0 models and submitted a new forecast (PEG_FUSION_1).  

## Modeling approach
### Spring 2021

The following models were submitted as part of Spring 2021 challenge, which predicts gcc_90 of next 35 days. 

* <b>PEG_RFR0:</b> 
  - <b>Input:</b> gcc_90 values of immediate past (last 5 days) as well as gcc_90 values from the last year (25 days), i.e., to predict t to (t+35) days of gcc_90, we used gcc_90 value from (t-1)th to (t-5)th day and gcc_90 value from (t-5)th to (t+19)th day of last year
  - <b>Output:</b> gcc_90 of total 36 days i.e., t to (t+35) days
  - <b>Model Description:</b> Random Forest Regressor is trained individually for each of the sites to predict gcc_90 using 3-fold cross-validation after dropping all the missing values of past gcc_90.
  
  The folder structure of PEG_RFR0 is given below:   
    - `models/` site-specific models wherein missing values of gcc_90 have been removed during training
    - `outputs/` daily predictions of the following 35 days of gcc_90 for each site
    - `submissions/` formatted for EFI submission
  
* <b>PEG_RFR:</b>
  - <b>Input:</b> gcc_90 values of immediate past (last 5 days) as well as gcc_90 values from the last year (20 days), i.e., to predict t to (t+35) days of gcc_90, we used gcc_90 value from (t-1)th to (t-5)th day and gcc_90 value from (t-5)th to (t+14)th day of last year
  - <b>Output:</b> gcc_90 of total 36 days i.e., t to (t+35) days
  - <b>Model Description:</b> Random Forest Regressor is trained individually for each of the sites to predict gcc_90 using 3-fold cross-validation after using interpolation strategy to fill in all the missing values of past gcc_90.
  
  The folder structure of PEG_RFR/ is given below:
  - `models/` site-specific models wherein missing values of gcc_90 have ____
  - `outputs` daily predictions of the following 35 days of gcc_90 for each site
  - `submissions/` formatted for EFI submission

  
* <b>PEG_RFR2:</b>
  - <b>Input:</b> gcc_90 values from the last year (15 days) and current weather data, i.e., to predict gcc_90 value of tth day, we use (t-7)th to (t+7)th daysâ€™ gcc_90 of last year and weather variables (max_temp, min_temp, radiation, precipitation) of tth day. Weather data extracted from Daymet is used to train the model. To forecast gcc_90 for future days, NOAA forecasted weather parameters are being used.
  - <b>Output:</b> gcc_90 of next 35 days i.e., (t+1) to (t+35) days
  - <b>Model Description:</b> Random Forest Regressor is trained individually for each of the sites to predict gcc_90 using 3-fold cross-validation after dropping all the missing values of input parameters.
  
  The folder structure of `PEG_RFR2/` is given below:
    - `models/` site-specific models trained on the full existing dataset
    - `outputs` daily predictions of the following 35 days of gcc_90 for each site
    - `submissions/` formatted for EFI submission

For the submission of forcast, gcc_sd of future days is just replaced by last years' gcc_sd value.
  
### Fall 2021

* <b>PEG_FUSION_0:</b> 
  - <b>Input:</b> gcc_90/rcc_90 data of 20 days from last year i.e., (t-10)th to (t+9)th day of last year and weather variables of tth day (Max. temp, Min. temp, Radiation, Precipitation)
  - <b>Output:</b> gcc_90/rcc_90 of next 35 days
  - <b>Model Description:</b> Ensemble machine learning approach is taken to predict gcc90/rcc_90, as part of which four models (Random Forest Regressor (RFR), ElasticNet Regressor, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XgBoost), K-Nearest Neighbor Regressor (KNN)) are trained individually for each of the sites to predict rcc_90 and three models (Random Forest Regressor (RFR), ElasticNet Regressor, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XgBoost)) are trained individually for each of the sites to predict gcc_90. Finally, rcc_90 and rcc_sd is predicted by taking the average and standard deviation of the predicted outputs by the four models and gcc_90 and rcc_sd is predicted by taking the average and standard deviation of the predicted outputs by the four models. 

  
  The folder structure of PEG_FUSION_0 is given below:   
    - `models/` site-specific models wherein missing values of gcc_90 have been removed during training
    - `outputs/` daily predictions of the following 35 days of gcc_90 for each site
    - `submissions/` formatted for EFI submission


  
## Forecasting pipeline
Our goal is to produce and submit daily forecasts. `forecast_gcc.sh` is a shell script that will run the R and python scripts needed to accomplish this goal. 
1. `01_pull_gcc_weather.R` downloads the latest gcc data and saves the .csv file in the `inputs` folder with the date of the most recent gcc value
2. `02_PEG_RFR0_gcc_predictions.py` ingests the most recent gcc data, gapfills if necessary, runs the 8 site-specific models in `PEG_RFR0/models`, and outputs csv file to `PEG_RFR0/outputs` with the run date
3. `03_PEG_RFR_gcc_predictions_with_interpolation.py` ingests the most recent gcc data, gapfills if necessary, runs the 8 site-specific models in `PEG_RFR/models`, and outputs csv file to `PEG_RFR/outputs` with the run date 
4. `04_PEG_RFR2_gcc_predictions_with_weather_variables.py` ingests the most recent gcc and weather forecast data, runs the 8 site-specific models in `PEG_RFR2/models`, and outputs csv file to `PEG_RFR2/outputs` with the run date
5. `05_submit_rfr.R` takes the latest output from `PEG_RFR0/outputs`, `PEG_RFR/outputs`, and `PEG_RFR2/outputs`, formats for submission, saves into respective `submissions/` folders, and submits to EFI competition website. 

## Forecasting submission

Daily forecasts are submitted automatically once per day using a chron job to run all the forecasting pipeline scripts on a CyVerse OpenStack server. 

Can log into server using `ssh -i [ssh key path] [username]@128.196.65.173`. It contains a copy of this repository, all of the required R and Python packages, and the following chron job: 

```
 SHELL=/bin/bash
 MAILTO=kristinariemer@email.arizona.edu
 00 22 * * * cd /home/kristinariemer/neon-datasets/models/RFR && bash forecast_gcc.sh && echo `date` >> /home/kristinariemer/cron.txt
 ```

Confirmation of submissions are in `cron.txt`.
